# Nick Whelan's VR Design Individual Project 2019
VR Filmmaking

I wholeheartedly believe that VR is the future of filmmaking and, as a film major, this was something that I knew that I had to explore for my individual project.

I began with intentions of filming my own 360* video, but ran into issues with that (mostly derrived from the intense hardware required) and decided to make a sort of VR movie theatre instead.

I considered recreating a movie theatre in VR, but decided against it since I've already seen so many of them and instead decided to opt for a more immersive experience. I chose the VR medium because I a) personally wanted to explore the application of film within this new medium and b) thought that fully immersing you in the film was best in a fully immersive environment. I did also choose to play the movie on the skybox itself instead of on a "screen" in attempts to further this immersive experience, but do think that the film's distortion was not worth sacrificing.

There's nothting that the user needs to know in advance, just hop in and enjoy!

To be incredibly clear, the video that you see was not created for this class. It is still entirely my work and my intellectual property, but I made a concious decision to display this piece instead of ripping a random YouTube video off of the internet. This project is focused on my explorations of the virtual space that filmmaking will soon take its stake in, but I wanted to make it clear that the film itself was not designed for this class since I know that that's technically plagarizing yourself and that was not my intent.

I would also like to add that I recognize that my project might be a little less impressive immediately than others, but I did put in the work. Almost all of the time that I spent on this project was learning the procedures behind video imports and with large file storage.  I wanted to create a more complex movie theatre with a variety of videos to choose from, but getting this one video onto GitHub was way harder than I could've ever imagined.

Unfortunately, I was unable to push a couple of key files to GitHub (even after the extensive research I did on Git Bash and LFS) but uploaded them to Google Drive. Please let me know if there is an issue with any of these files, although things should run smoothly as tested.
