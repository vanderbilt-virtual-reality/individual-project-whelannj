# Nick Whelan's Individual Project
VR Filmmaking

I wholeheartedly believe that VR is the future of filmmaking and, as a film major, this was something that I knew that I had to explore as my individual project.

I began with intentions of filming my own 360* video, but ran into issues with that (mostly derrived from the hardware limitations) and decided to make a sort of VR movie theatre instead.
