# Nick Whelan's VR Design Individual Project 2019
Specializing in VR Filmmaking

I wholeheartedly believe that VR is the future of filmmaking and, as a filmmaker, this was something that I knew that I had to explore for my individual project in a class that focuses on pushing the technology.

I began with relative intentions of filming my own 360* video, but ran into issues with that idea that were mostly derrived from the intense hardware and technology required and decided to make a sort of VR movie theatre instead. I then considered recreating a movie theatre in the typical sense in VR, but decided against it since I've already seen so many of them and instead decided to opt for a more immersive experience using a skybox "movie screen."

I chose to make this in the medium of VR because I a) personally wanted to explore the application of film within this new medium and b) thought that fully immersing you in the film was best in a fully immersive environment like VR offers to the filmmaker. I did also choose to play the movie on the skybox itself instead of on a "screen" in attempts to further this immersive experience, but do think that the film's distortion was not worth sacrificing. I additionally wanted to create a more complex movie theatre with a variety of videos to choose from, but getting this one video onto GitHub was way harder than I could've ever imagined.

There's nothting that the user needs to know in advance, just hop in and enjoy! While the video demo does show some elements of the project, there's nothing like experiencing this story in its entirety (around five minutes) in VR!

Unfortunately, I was unable to push a large section of my project through to GitHub (even after the extensive research I did on Git Bash and LFS) but uploaded it to Google Drive. What's currently on GitHub under my project is this ReadMe and what should be my project before I inported the video into Unity. Please let me know if there is an issue with any of these files, although things should run as smoothly as tested.

To be incredibly clear, the video that you see within this environment was not created for this class. It is still entirely my work and my intellectual property, but I made a concious decision to display this piece instead of ripping a random YouTube video off of the internet. This project is focused on my explorations within the virtual space that filmmaking will soon take its place in, but I want to make it clear that the film itself was not designed for this class since I know that this is technically me plagarizing myself and that was not my intent in the slightest. Please grade it as such and do not include the video's quality in that analysis, unless you really liked it. :)

I would also like to add that I recognize that my project might be a little less impressive at first glance than others, but I did put in the work. I really wanted to explore a medium that I was confident very few (if any) were going to tackle because of how new, incomplete and difficult it currently is. Almost all of the time that I spent working on this project was spent learning about the procedures behind video imports and with large file storage.

Thanks for a genuinely facinating class and for pushing me to create things I never thought I could!
