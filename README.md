# Nick Whelan's Individual Project
VR Filmmaking

I wholeheartedly believe that VR is the future of filmmaking and, as a film major, this was something that I knew that I had to explore as my individual project.

I began with intentions of filming my own 360* video, but ran into issues with that (mostly derrived from the hardware limitations) and decided to make a sort of VR movie theatre instead.

To be incredibly clear, the video that you see was not created for this class. It is still entirely my work and my intellectual property, but I made a concious decision to display this piece instead of ripping a random YouTube video off of the internet. This project is focused on my explorations of the virtual space that filmmaking will soon take its stake in, but I wanted to make it clear that the film itself was not designed for this class since I know that that's technically plagarizing yourself and that was not my intent.
